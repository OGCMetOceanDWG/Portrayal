The existing OGC standards for visualising and styling information are very 2D, map layer, orientated. As 3D environments, such as gaming, military simulation, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, become more ubiquitous, this repository is to capture Use Cases, Requirements and proposals not tied to a 2D flat earth paradigm that will be usesful to the Meteorological, Oceanographic and other communities. 
The work will be parallel to that for establishing modern, RESTful, convenient APIs for weather information.
